## Hi there 👋

With a background in Computational Linguistics, I explore how natural language processing and artificial intelligence can be used to analyze, understand, and generate human language — with the goal of making complex information more accessible to everyone.

I have worked on a broad range of NLP tasks, including machine translation, text classification, information extraction, text generation, and linguistic data analysis based on domain-specific corpora. I am particularly interested in how language technologies can impact education and society.
